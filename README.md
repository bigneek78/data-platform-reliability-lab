# Data Platform Reliability & Support Engineering Lab

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a structured approach to scaling engineering support for distributed data platforms using controlled failure injection, observability-driven validation, automation, and runbook standardization.

The objective is to model operational maturity practices that reduce support friction, improve incident resolution efficiency, and strengthen platform resilience.

---

## Architecture Summary

The lab simulates a Kafka-based distributed ingestion system with:

- Synthetic event producers
- Controlled broker failure testing
- Consumer lag impact validation
- Automated evidence collection
- Structured runbook-driven remediation
- Post-incident documentation workflows
- Infrastructure-as-Code extension via Terraform

---

## Reliability Testing Workflow

1. Start the platform with Docker Compose
2. Generate controlled event load
3. Simulate Kafka broker failure
4. Capture structured incident evidence
5. Quantify consumer lag impact
6. Generate automated incident summary
7. Document findings via runbook + postmortem templates
